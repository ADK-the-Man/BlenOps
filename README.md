# BlenOps
BlenOps is a containerized application that provides the feasibility of rendering the blend files via the pod and containers. To be specific, this project renders a blend file and adds a mp3 file to it enhancing the output to an mp4 file with the 3D name reveal with Audio. 

We have used the blender image from the linuxserver/blender and programmed the application using the Flask in Python further exporting the videos to the pod mount (for instance).
